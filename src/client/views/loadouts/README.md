# views/loadouts/

Placeholder for the loadout management UI (issue #44).

The loadout store backend is complete (Phase 2, PR #46, 100 tests).
This directory will contain `loadouts.js` and `loadouts.css` when the UI is built.

Until then, the existing drydock view (`views/drydock/`) provides dock management.
