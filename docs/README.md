# docs/

Project documentation and decision records.

## Purpose
- Stores runbooks, setup notes, ADRs, QA notes, and operational guidance.

## Source-Controlled vs Generated
- Source-controlled: all Markdown docs in this directory.
- Generated: none expected by default (new generated reports should be clearly named and reviewed before commit).

## Safe Usage
- Keep docs concise and actionable; update existing docs rather than creating near-duplicates.
- Put transient execution evidence in `receipts/` instead of long-form docs here.
