# legacy/

Historical implementation artifacts kept for reference.

## Purpose
- Preserves older Python-era tooling and notes that are not part of the active runtime path.

## Source-Controlled vs Generated
- Source-controlled: legacy scripts and supporting files in this directory.
- Generated: none expected here.

## Safe Usage
- Do not add new product behavior here; place active work under `src/`.
- Use legacy files for migration/reference only unless a maintenance task explicitly targets them.
